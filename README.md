# Fractals in Python

## Introduction
This repository contains my personal collection of Python scripts for generating and visualizing fractals. Fractals are fascinating mathematical structures that exhibit self-similarity at different scales. 

## Examples

### Lyapunov fractals

## Installation

To run the fractal scripts, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. Additionally, you might want to install any dependencies specific to certain scripts. You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Each fractal script is located in its own directory and may have its own set of parameters. You can run a script using the following command:
```
python script_name.py
```
