# Fractals in Python

## Introduction
This repository contains my personal collection of Python scripts for generating and visualizing fractals. Fractals are fascinating mathematical structures that exhibit self-similarity at different scales. 

## Lyapunov Fractals

Lyapunov fractals are generated through the analysis of chaotic behavior in iterated mathematical functions. The fractals depict the stability of trajectories by computing Lyapunov exponents, representing the rate of divergence or convergence of nearby points. Lyapunov fractals are generated by the script using Numba with CUDA, allowing for efficient parallel computation of Lyapunov exponents.

## Newton Fractals

Newton fractals are a type of fractal generated through iterative processes applied to complex equations. These fractals illustrate the roots or solutions of equations by examining the convergence or divergence of points under iteration. Each color or shade in the fractal corresponds to the root that a particular point converges towards.

## Installation

To run the fractal scripts, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. Additionally, you might want to install any dependencies specific to certain scripts. You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Each fractal script is located in its own directory and may have its own set of parameters. You can run a script using the following command:
```
python script_name.py
```
